Creating a SparkSession
In this exercise, you'll spin up a local Spark cluster using all available cores. The cluster will be accessible via a SparkSession object.

The SparkSession class has a builder attribute, which is an instance of the Builder class. The Builder class exposes three important methods that let you:

specify the location of the master node;
name the application (optional); and
retrieve an existing SparkSession or, if there is none, create a new one.
The SparkSession class has a version attribute which gives the version of Spark.

Find out more about SparkSession here.

Once you are finished with the cluster, it's a good idea to shut it down, which will free up its resources, making them available for other processes.

Note:: You might find it useful to revise the slides from the lessons in the Slides panel next to the IPython Shell.


Import the SparkSession class from pyspark.sql.
Create a SparkSession object connected to a local cluster. Use all available cores. Name the application 'test'.
Retrieve the version of Spark running on the cluster.
Shut down the cluster.

# Import the PySpark module
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create SparkSession object
spark = SparkSession.builder \
                    .master('local[*]') \
                    .appName('test') \
                    .getOrCreate()

# What version of Spark?
print(spark.version)

# Terminate the cluster
spark.stop()

Loading flights data
In this exercise you're going to load some airline flight data from a CSV file. To ensure that the exercise runs quickly these data have been trimmed down to only 50 000 records. You can get a larger dataset in the same format here.

Notes on CSV format:

fields are separated by a comma (this is the default separator) and
missing data are denoted by the string 'NA'.
Data dictionary:

mon — month (integer between 1 and 12)
dom — day of month (integer between 1 and 31)
dow — day of week (integer; 1 = Monday and 7 = Sunday)
org — origin airport (IATA code)
mile — distance (miles)
carrier — carrier (IATA code)
depart — departure time (decimal hour)
duration — expected duration (minutes)
delay — delay (minutes)
pyspark has been imported for you and the session has been initialized.

Note: The data have been aggressively down-sampled.

Read data from a CSV file called 'flights.csv'. Assign data types to columns automatically. Deal with missing data.
How many records are in the data?
Take a look at the first five records.
What data types have been assigned to the columns? Do these look correct?

# Read data from CSV file
flights = spark.read.csv('flights.csv',
                         sep=',',
                         header=True,
                         inferSchema=True,
                         nullValue= 'NA')

# Get number of records
print("The data contain %d records." % flights.count())

# View the first five records
flights.show(5)

# Check column data types
flights.dtypes
